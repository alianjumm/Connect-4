## Play the Game

The game can be accessed [here](https://alianjumm.github.io/Connect-4/). It requires two players. Remember, yellow always goes first. When the game concludes, the winner will be displayed in the status bar. Good luck and follow the rules.

## Future Work

- **A working CPU**. The original plan for the game was to implement a working AI (CPU). However, due to time constraints, this was not possible.
- **Varying difficulty for the CPU**. A very simple implementation of the CPU would be to allow for the computer to hop randomly into any accessible space under the rules of the game. However, this may be considered "easy" mode. By coding for more targeted movement based on a player's pieces on the board, this allows for a higher difficulty.
